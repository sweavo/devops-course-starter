# stuff that I will definitely* do in my ample free time

* Figure out how to have poetry insist that main works for python 3.7 while also supporting flake8 and pytest
* simplify the app's mapping to trello, it's already too general purpose, creating a structure more complicated than will fit in a .env file
* make the app pretty, but that's front-end bro stuff, and I'm a devops guy now.
